## Task
A research on Google Play Store and You will publish it on any blog platform of your choice.
To drive your Analysis:
Plot with bar diagram the most populars paid apps of Family category
Plot with a pie diagram the most popular genres according to the number of installations from paid family
An array with the number of installation per category
Plot a pie with the number of installation per category
Plot a bar with the mean price per category

I will just shoot some questions here:

What is the size of the market? numbers of download and $
Same question but per category? (percentages please)
Depending on each category, what are the ratio of download per app?

## Description
This code performs data cleaning and exploration on a dataset stored in a CSV file called googleplaystore.csv. Here is an overview of the code:
Import necessary libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and random.
Define a function load_dataset() that returns a Pandas DataFrame object loaded from the CSV file.
Call the load_dataset() function and assign the resulting DataFrame object to the variable data.
Define a function print_summarize_dataset(data) that prints out a summary of the dataset including its dimensions, the first 10 rows, and some statistical information.
Call the print_summarize_dataset(data) function to display the summary of the dataset.
Overall, this code imports libraries and defines functions that are used to explore the dataset stored in the CSV file. The load_dataset() function loads the data into a Pandas DataFrame, which is then passed to the print_summarize_dataset() function to print out information about the data.

## Installation
No installation required just importation of the necessary libraries.

## Usage
Not required for this exercise.
